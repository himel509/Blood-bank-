# Blood-bank-
A simple C-based Blood Donation Management System using linked lists and file handling. Supports donor registration, searching, and donation tracking with strict validation (age, BMI, weight, blood group, division–district mapping). Donors remain ineligible for 4 months after donating. Data is saved in a text file for persistence.
